# Ultra-Wide-Band-for-social-distancing
This project aims at exploring novel techniques to reduce the spread of COVID-19 through the implementation of contact tracing with Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals. The user movements in an office environment are detected via Wi-Fi 802.11 and an alert is triggered if CDC guidelines are not followed.
